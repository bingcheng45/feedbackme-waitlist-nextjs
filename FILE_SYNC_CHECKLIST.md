# File Synchronization Checklist

## Purpose
Quick reference to ensure `.cursorrules` and `CLAUDE.md` stay synchronized when changes are made to either file.

## Synchronization Mapping

| .cursorrules Section | CLAUDE.md Section | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Code Style and Structure | Code Standards | ✅ Synced |
| Development Workflow | Development Workflow | ✅ Synced |
| UI and Styling | Design System Implementation | ✅ Synced |
| Performance Optimization | Performance Standards | ✅ Synced |
| Database & API | Database & API Standards | ✅ Synced |
| TODO System Management | Task Management Rules | ✅ Synced |
| File Synchronization Rules | File Synchronization Requirements | ✅ Synced |

## Before Making Changes

- [ ] Identify which file needs to be updated (primary)
- [ ] Determine which sections will be affected
- [ ] Review corresponding sections in the other file
- [ ] Plan the synchronization approach

## After Making Changes

- [ ] Updated corresponding sections in the secondary file
- [ ] Verified consistency between both files
- [ ] No conflicting information exists
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate
- [ ] Both files maintain their unique purposes
- [ ] Updated PRD.md with synchronization completion
- [ ] Tested both files work as expected

## Synchronization Process

1. **Identify Changes**: What sections were modified?
2. **Map Sections**: Which corresponding sections need updates?
3. **Update Secondary**: Make matching changes to the other file
4. **Verify Consistency**: Check for conflicts or inconsistencies
5. **Test Functionality**: Ensure both files work properly
6. **Document in PRD**: Update PRD.md with sync completion

## Emergency Sync Check

Run this quick verification:
- [ ] Both files reference each other correctly
- [ ] Tech stack information is identical
- [ ] Development rules are consistent
- [ ] File naming conventions match
- [ ] Project structure references align
- [ ] Performance standards are the same
- [ ] No conflicting guidance exists
